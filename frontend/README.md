Welcome to BookHaven 
This is my very own e-commerce website for books, built using React! It's a simple project that lets users browse a collection of books, add them to a shopping cart, and even go through a checkout process.

I used a technologies like React Context to manage the shopping cart globally—meaning you can add an item on one page and see it on another!

What Does it Do? (Features)
Book Catalog: A page where you can see all the available books and quickly search for them by title, author, or category.

Shopping Cart: You can add books from any page and see them all on the Cart page. You can change the quantity or remove items.

Book Details Pages: Click on any book to see a detailed description, price, and cover image.

Checkout: A simple checkout page to see your final order total and "place" a dummy order.

Responsive Design: I used React-Bootstrap to make sure the site looks good on phones, tablets, and computers.
